      <description>I have used Vim on and off for the past few years, and since March of this year I have taken to customizing Vim to make it a great developer environment. Over the last month I started acquainting myself with Emacs for the first time and I used it for a few weeks as my main editor for web development.
Vim wins As of today, I still prefer Vim.</description>
