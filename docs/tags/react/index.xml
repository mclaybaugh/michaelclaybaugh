      <description>I created minesweeper using React and Parcel. Check it out!
The goals of this implementation were as follows:
 Use React and React hooks Keep the dependencies and build process as simple as possible  State management in React As I began working on the project, I started using the ‘useState’ hook and then shortly after upgraded to ‘useReducer’. While this hook was able to do everything I needed for this app, I do not believe that going through the React documentation for hooks is a good way for developers to get introduced to state management.</description>
